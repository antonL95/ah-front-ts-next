    "content": "Where we work from is a fundamental tenet of our identity. In the post-covid world, offices are increasingly competing with our homes, co-working hubs, cafés, and virtually any place with an internet connection.\n\nHowever, many people still want to come into offices. Observing the current trends, our time together in the workspace may typically be limited to a few days per week. How do we make the most of it? By making the time together an experience. What matters is an increased level of creativity, engagement, and mental well-being, in tandem with a high-energy working environment.\n\nWorkspaces are dramatically changing. Quality is winning over quantity. Only through designing experiential workspaces are companies able to attract, engage, and inspire high-performing talent. What role does art play in creating such an experience?\n\nAccording to research by International Art Consultants with the collaboration of British Council for Offices (BCO), the presence of art in the workplace enables higher levels of creativity, productivity, wellbeing & engagement and contributes positively to branding."

      "content": "According to research by International Art Consultants, 61% of respondents confirmed that art in the work environment inspires them to be more creative. Some 11% of respondents expressed that art makes them more productive. Research also indicated that there was 30% higher productivity in companies where employees were allowed to design their own workspace with plants, furniture, and artwork.\n\nCorporate workspaces are about environment and experience. These factors can work in favor of both the employer and the employees. It is clear that art inspires creativity and can lead to an increase in productivity. Companies should place more focus on maximizing the output of their key asset - their people. If your business can increase productivity by even 2% or 3%, the whole art initiative becomes worth it."

      "subheadline": "of respondents expressed that art makes the\n workplace feel more welcoming.",
      "content": "Given that in the services industry, 80% of business costs are people, it makes sound financial sense to make employees feel as good as possible in the workplace. Well-chosen art can make all the difference. A staggering 94% of respondents expressed that art makes the workplace feel more welcoming.\n\nIt’s not enough for office art to be purely decorative, it needs to engage and motivate a peripatetic and fluctuating personnel. One effective approach is to put staff at the centre of the company's art strategy, involving them in choosing, displaying, or even creating workplace art. This kind of empowerment has been shown to have a very positive effect on staff morale.\n\nDuring post-pandemic times defined by austerity, it is easy to forget that culture, art, and design can increase value and improve individual and collective wellbeing. This is a key consideration given that we are living in a time of shifting work styles when many can opt to work from home or anywhere else. Investing in amenities that will draw employees back into the office is a sensible and rather subtle strategy and is one that workplace art can do much to support.\n\nAnd why does bringing people together matter? The physical (at least occasional) presence of people helps build relationships, trust and fosters a creative approach to solving unique problems, which is crucial for high-performing companies."

      "content": "The contemporary office often starts out as an anonymous and uniform space. Art can be the perfect tool for infusing a bit of personality. Art can individualize and contextualize a workspace and can also be an effective branding tool. 75% of respondents claim that art helps to communicate brand values and emphasizes identity.\n\nSome companies select artworks that embody their corporate values, others use art to represent the culture or history of their company. Unusual-looking art might suggest that the company thinks outside the box in their business practices. When innovation and creativity are fundamental to a company’s way of doing business, artwork can catalyze meaningful discussions. Carefully chosen artworks or artists can reflect the unique skills and values of the business."
